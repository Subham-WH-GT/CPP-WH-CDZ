Abstraction :

      /* It is a process in which only the essential information is passed with keeping the non-essential information

           hidden.

            like--In a class/object abstraction is useful for a methods...where only the function call and the output result

                  is observed keeping the implementation details hidden.

                  like for a function say POW--we use it  as POW(x,y) and the result comes out as x^y...but how the function is 

                    implemented is not known to us or is actually hidden to us, this is how abstraction works...
